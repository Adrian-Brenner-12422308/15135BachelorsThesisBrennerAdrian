# 15135BachelorsThesisBrennerAdrian

This Repository includes the code files, dataset (survey) and do-files for the Bachelor's Thesis of Adrian Brenner (GSI LMU). (The prolonging Abyssinian Crisis - Contemporary conflict politics of the Ethiopian government)

The survey results are split into location-based folders (the location in which the survey was conducted. Example: AA = Addis Ababa). Each folder holds an INFORMATION file and a BASE_CODE file which provide statistical insight into the survey material, success rate and further statistic iterations. 

Note that this survey and work was not done on behalf of the GSI LMU but represents a personal study required for this Bachelor Thesis. For any questions regarding replication and/or issues in reading files please contact Adrian.Brenner@lmu.campus.de
