# 15135BachelorsThesisBrennerAdrian

This Repository includes the code files, dataset (survey) and do-files for the Bachelor's Thesis of Adrian Brenner (GSI LMU). (The prolonging Abyssinian Crisis - Contemporary conflict politics of the Ethiopian government)

The survey results are split into location-based folders (the location in which the survey was conducted. Example: AA = Addis Ababa). Each folder holds an INFORMATION file which provides numeric count insights into the survey material. If a .pdf file takes too long to load refreshing the page usually helps, this is due to the .pdf's file nature as they are uploaded, not GitHub-coded, files.

Note that this survey and work was not done on behalf of the GSI LMU but represents a personal study required for this Bachelor Thesis. For any questions regarding replication and/or issues in reading files please contact Adrian.Brenner@lmu.campus.de
