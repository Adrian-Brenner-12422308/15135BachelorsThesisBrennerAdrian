This file contains the total conducted survey information of all locations.

418 survey attempts.
29 invalid.
203 valid.

Note here that a valid survey does not automatically equal in every participants answering all question.
As such several questions do not add up to the total of 203.

Further note that people who instantly rejected the survey were not counted towards survey attempts,
only people who were initially interested but decided not to proceed upon being handed the survey physically are attributed to a survey attempt.
